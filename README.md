<h1> Library Management System </h1>
   
  This project was developed during my internship in TÃ¼bitak Bilgem
 
  Used technologies:
  * Ember JS
  * Spring Boot
  * RESTful Web Service
  * Cassandra NoSQL
  * MySQL
  * Docker
  
  There are 2 versions of the project. The NoSQL is in master branch and mysql is in the mysql branch. Since the searching operations are rather so slow in Cassandra, I changed the database to MySQL.
